# Greenring Discord Bot ðŸ¤–

## Commands
### Open/Close Trades ðŸ“ˆ
All commands should follow the form _**[Action] [Symbol]**_

For example: Buy AAPL, Sell AMZN

The program will automatically fetch the current market price for the ticker, and amount of shares should not be disclosed.

Accepted formats of actions include:
- Buy, bot, bought
- sell, sold, sel, close
- short, shorted
- cover, covered

Note that as of now, it is required that all trades be made within market hours.

### !getrank ðŸ¥‡

This feature returns a Discord Embed of the top ranking users by their profit, for the duration of all time. Users can scroll through pages by reacting with the emojis below the embed. Currently working on adding functionality for getting rankings with regard to a range of dates. 




If you find any issues with the bot, please ping me on Discord _**@rgld**_. Do your best to find any errors as the pot should endure rigorous testing before being released to the public. Also let me know if the bot goes offline as I am currently running it on my laptop.
